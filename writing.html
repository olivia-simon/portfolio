        <p> While I don't advocate pre-writing sacrificial blood-shedding, Hemingway did capture the fundamental paradox of writing - we have to give all of ourselves to our writing, or we have nothing at all. </p> <br>

<p> Well, I'm here to give all of myself in my writing to make your content better. I'd love to join forces with your writing staff, blogging team, or work freelance for you. My philosphy is to write efficiently, concisely, but with a sense of humor (and maybe a little less blood than Hemmingway would suggest). </p> <br>

            If you’re like me, you might be a little intimidated by kimchi. While this Korean side dish is simply seasoned fermented vegetables, the prospect of eating it, let alone making it, might seem farfetched. But I encourage you to embrace kimchi, because it’s a delicious way to spice up a fried rice, dumplings, spring rolls, or really anything. And, if you follow this easy kimchi recipe...continue reading

             Bacon is delicious in any form it comes in: wrapped around chicken, with eggs and hash, in sandwiches, and even as ice cream (yes, that exists). But, maybe you’re reluctant to make bacon at home because of the greasy, awful mess it can leave in your kitchen. If you want to avoid oil splatters on your stovetop, try baking bacon in the oven instead – it’s simple, tidy, and highly delicious...continue reading

             If you’re a fan of milk and cookies (and really, who isn’t?), then adding a cookie cup into your dessert repertoire is absolutely essential. Cookie cups, as their name implies, are cookies baked into a mug and lined with chocolate, so you can pour milk directly into your cookie and drink from it.
